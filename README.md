## Welcome to my profile!

My name is Morgan, and I am a post-graduate student currently studying a masters in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Nottingham. I am interested in Machine learning and data science! I graduated with a first class honours degree in Business and Management at the University of Leicester. I also have technical work experience through my internship at Virgin Active, where I developed an information repository and used NLP to label and sort large quantities of documentation accurately. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding intelligence through building systems. In this instance, I am building an agent which reacts to its environment (INSERT URL)
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning concepts surrounding Computer Vision, Designing intelligent agents and preparing for my dissertation.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to begin my professional career in a graduate tech role (Software Engineering, Machine learning or consultancy) in Sepmtember 2026 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganjones082004/).
